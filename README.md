Capstone Project 1 : Financing the un-financed (Social Financial lending)
Financing or loans are essential for any community. Today,banks are desperate to provide loans to individuals having good tracking financial/credit history. But many people are not part of this system, they don't have trackable financial history and thus Banks are reluctant to offer loans to them. And these people are often exploited by local untrustworthy lenders.Idea is to predict borrowers' repayment capability by using other easily available dataset like telco and transactional information. The problem is to predict loan pay-ability using various statistical and machine learning methods on the provided data set.
We want to enable the banks to decide whether the borrower will be able to pay the loan back on the basis of different factors related to the borrowerâ€™s social and financial status.
